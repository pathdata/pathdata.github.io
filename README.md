# Biography

My research interests focus on the interface of progression of cancer lesion and translational software development to address the unknown gaps in treating cancer and I am in the pursuit of high quality, quantitative bioimaging. This interface requires the integration of skills from computing, engineering, cancer biology, pathology, genomics and the life sciences and, as such, my research career has moved me between disciplines and has always involved a large number of cross-disciplinary collaborations.
